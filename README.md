Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code that was pre-written and given to me were GameExperience.py, TreasureMaze.py, and most of TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. The code that I wrote myself was a reinforcment learning algorithm which creates a game loop that uses the Keras and Tensorflow libraries to solve a pathfinding problem.
